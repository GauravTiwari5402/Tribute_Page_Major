CITATION
MOHIT SHARMA
1 PARA (SF)
Major Mohit Sharma, SM was leading Bravo Assault Team in operations in Kupwara District of North Kashmir. A valiant warrior, he excelled in the art of fighting guerrillas in jungle terrain having earlier spent four years in Jammu & Kashmir. On 21 March 2009, after receiving information of presence of some infiltrating terrorists in dense Haphruda Forest, he planned meticulously and led his commandos in tracking them. On observing suspicious movement, he alerted his scouts but terrorists fired from three directions indiscriminately. In the heavy exchange of fire, four commandos were wounded immediately. With complete disregard to his safety, he crawled and recovered two soldiers to safety. Unmindful of the overwhelming fire, he threw grenades and killed two terrorists but was shot in the chest. In the brief respite that followed, he kept directing his commandos, in spite of serious injuries. Sensing further danger to his comrades, he charged in a daring close quarter combat killing two more terrorists and attained martyrdom fighting for his motherland in the finest traditions of Indian Army.

For this act of conspicuous gallantry, inspiring leadership and exceptional courage far beyond call of duty, Major Mohit Sharma, SM was awarded ‘Ashok Chakra’ (Posthumous) on 15 Aug 09.

           <h2> Major As Iftikhar</h2>
              <p>The valour of Para Special Forces Officer Major Mohit Sharma, who was posthumously awarded the Ashoka Chakra in 2009, still reverberates in his hometown of Rohtak in Haryana. He was killed in action during a military operation in Kupwara District of North Kashmir on March 21, 2009. But his fascinating tale of gallantry during a covert operation in March 2004 still lives on to inspire millions of Indians.</p>
              
              
              <p>Major Mohit Sharma concocted a story to convince the Hizbul Mujahideen terrorists of his plans to attack the Indian army. He told them that his brother was killed by the Indian security personnel in 2001. He told Torara and Sabzar that he wanted to avenge his brothers’ death and needed help from the duo. Major Sharma informed them that he wanted to carry out a terror attack at an Army checkpoint and had done the ‘necessary groundwork’ for the same.</p>
              <p>The Para Special Forces Officer showed them hand-drawn maps of army movement in an unknown hill trail, which ‘moderately impressed’ Torara and Sabzar. Demonstrating his motivation, Major Sharma said, “I need your support, I want to learn.” The duo, who had been running a terror recruitment programme in South Kashmir, wanted to know more about him. ‘Who are you?’, Torara inquired on several occasions, suggesting that there was a deficit in trust somewhere.</p>
              <p>But, nevertheless, they decided to help him execute his plans. The Hizbul Mujahideen terrorists informed Major Sharma that would go underground for several weeks and help in coordinating the logistics and finer points for the proposed terror attack. He convinced them that he would not return to his village until he had struck an army checkpoint. Soon, in the coming days, Torara and Sabzar arranged for a consignment of grenades, besides summoning three other terrorists from a nearby village.</p>
              <h4>THE FINAL BLOW</h4>
              <p>When Torara began having second thoughts, Major Sharma said, “If you have any doubts about me, kill me.” While dropping his Ak-47 rifle, he said, “You cannot do this if you don’t trust me. So you have no choice but to kill me now.” This caught Torara in a state of dilemma, who then looked at Sabzar for redressal. While both were caught off guard, Major Mohit Sharma seized the opportunity, took out his loaded 9-mm pistol and shot them dead.</p>
              <h2>Kupwara Operation: 21st March 2009</h2>
              <p>During 2009, Maj Mohit Sharma’s unit was deployed in Kupwara district of J & K and was engaged in operations against the terrorists on a frequent basis. Based on the information received from the intelligence about the infiltration attempt by some terrorists in Kupwara district, the security forces decided to launch a search and destroy operation on 21 Mar 2009.  Maj Mohit Sharma was tasked to lead the Bravo Assault Team against the infiltrating terrorists in dense Haphruda Forest. Maj Mohit Sharma along with his commandos reached the suspected area as planned and soon made contact with the infiltrators. On observing suspicious movement, he alerted his scouts but the terrorists fired at the troops from three directions indiscriminately.  In the heavy exchange of fire, four commandos got wounded and with complete disregard to his personal safety, Maj Mohit Sharma crawled and recovered two soldiers to safety.</p>
              <p>Unnerved Maj Mohit Sharma continuing the operation threw grenades and managed to kill two terrorists. However during the exchange of fire Maj Mohit got hit in the chest. Despite seriously wounded he kept directing his commandos, to foil the attempt of the terrorists to escape. In the ensuing battle he realized further danger to his comrades, and in a rare display of raw courage and determination charged at the terrorists, killing two of them in the close combat. Later he succumbed to his injuries and attained martyrdom fighting for his motherland in the finest traditions of Indian Army. Maj Mohit Sharma was given the nation’s highest peace time gallantry award, “Ashok Chakra” for his act of conspicuous gallantry, unyielding fighting spirit and supreme sacrifice.</p>
              <p>Maj Mohit Sharma is survived by his father Shri Rajendra Prasad Sharma, mother Smt Sushila Sharma, elder brother Shri Madhur Sharma and wife Maj Rishima Sharma, who is an Army officer and continuing his legacy of service to the nation.</p>
